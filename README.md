# Reinforcement Learning for Grid world Game Agent Using Value Iteration and Q-learning
Reinforcement learning is a method of learning that involves a software agent learning to interact with its environment in order to achieve a reward for reaching a desired goal or being punished for not reaching it. It is a field in Machine Learning that involves a Training mechanism of making agents/robots learn from experience or past actions by trial and error till an optimal solution is arrived at. This type of learning has a wide range of applications, including gaming, and is often used to design agents that can beat humans at certain games. In this study, two reinforcement learning algorithms, value iteration and Q-learning, are compared. Both algorithms are based on the concept of a Markov decision process, which involves the agent's next action being based on the current state rather than the past. Value iteration involves directly computing the optimal value function for each state, while Q-learning estimates the action-value function through trial and error. While value iteration is generally more efficient and guarantees convergence to the optimal solution, Q-learning can be more flexible and efficient in problems with large or continuous state spaces.
